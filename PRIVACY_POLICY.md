**Last Updated:** December 6, 2024

## Introduction

Tappy Toes - Pregnancy & Baby Helper App ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

Tappy Toes is designed with privacy in mind. All your data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. We do NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

The app stores the following data locally on your device:
- Baby kick tracking records (timestamps)
- Diaper change logs (pee and poop timestamps)
- Feeding records (type, amount, timestamps)
- Medicine reminders and logs
- App settings and preferences

## How We Use Your Information

Your data is used solely to provide the app's functionality:
- Track pregnancy-related activities (baby kicks)
- Monitor baby care activities (diaper changes, feeding, medicine)
- Set up reminders for medicine schedules
- Display statistics and summaries

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally on your device using React Native AsyncStorage
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not sync your data to any cloud services or external servers

- **Device Security**: Your data security depends on your device's security. We recommend using device lock features

## Notifications

The app requests permission to send local notifications for medicine reminders. These notifications are generated locally on your device and do not involve any external servers.

## Children's Privacy

While Tappy Toes is designed to help track baby-related activities, it is intended for use by parents and caregivers. The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time through the app's reset functions:
- Individual category data can be reset from the History tab
